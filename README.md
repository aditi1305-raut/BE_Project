# Diagnosing Respiratory Conditions via Lung Sound using CNN and LSTM

A deep learning-based system that diagnoses respiratory diseases using lung sound recordings. This project combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to automatically classify lung sounds like wheezes, crackles, and rhonchi to aid in early detection of conditions such as asthma, pneumonia, bronchitis, and COPD.

## üß† Abstract

This project presents a cost-effective, non-invasive, and accurate system for diagnosing respiratory conditions using machine learning. We extract Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients (GTCC) and Short-Time Fourier Coefficients (STFC) features from lung sounds and classify them using CNN-LSTM models. The system processes over 6800 audio clips, achieving a peak accuracy of **99.22%**.
